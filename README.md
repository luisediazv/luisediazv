# About me

I'm Luis. I'm an architecture student from Venezuela.

- I have working experience with typical AEC software tools (Revit, Rhino and AutoCAD).
- I love architecture and recently I started learning about software engineering as an interest in building for the AEC industry.
- I'm interested in learning different web-based tools and programming languages such as C, Python and JavaScript.
