# I'm Luis.
## I'm an architecture student from Venezuela.

### About me

- I have working experience with typical AEC software tools (Revit, AutoCAD, SketchUp and Rhino).
- I love architecture and recently I started learning about software engineering as an interest in building for the AEC industry.
- I'm interested in learning different web-based tools, frameworks and programming languages such as C++, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript and React.
